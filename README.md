CFPG Family Tree

This is a full-stack application about preserving and updating a family tree. Users of the app can see our family lineage, view biographies of each family member in the tree, see a timeline of important family events, and even view historic documents that are unique to our family history.

Technologies Used
The application is built using PostgreSQL, C#.NET, React.js, and Redux.js. This repository is the backend part of the application (click here for the frontend).

Background / Motivation
The idea for this project was conceived in August 2020. My grandmother was turning 100-years old in December of that year, and I wanted to give her and the family a gift that would be extremely beneficial and long-lasting to commerate a historic milestone. A family tree had been previously created 10 years prior on a pen and paper, which was put on the wall of my grandmother's basement. Knowing that it needed to be upgraded and digitized, I began designing and building the application.

The project aims to acheive the following:
Allow for dynamic expansion and editing of family lineage
Decentralize responsibility of editing so that each user of the app can make additions and edits
Include biographical content of each family member to enhance and preserve our family history
